The app lists duck sightings. By default only species of the sighting and its date are displayed. You can extend any row of the list by clicking on it. The extended view gives you further information about the sighting.

The list may be ordered by date of the sightings. You can also search the list to find specific species.

New sightings must have valid species and count.
